# LanguageClassifier 
(Spanish/English/German/Russian)

This project uses [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) to transcribe audio files and a machine learning pipeline to classify the spoken language based on the transcription. It includes a Flask web interface where users can upload audio files and receive a prediction.
Simple web application (Flask API) for detecting one language mentioned above.
I preprocess data by extracting mfcc from mp3 files, then Text Classification Pipeline process transcripted audio and learns how to recognize which language is it.
