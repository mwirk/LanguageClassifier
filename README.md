# 🌍 LanguageClassifier  
Detect spoken language from audio (Spanish 🇪🇸 / English 🇬🇧 / German 🇩🇪 / Russian 🇷🇺)

This project uses [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) to transcribe `.mp3` audio files and a classical machine learning pipeline to classify the **spoken language** based on the **transcription**. It includes a simple **Flask web interface** where users can upload audio files and receive a prediction.

Web Interface (Flask)

A minimal Flask API allows users to:

Upload .mp3 audio
Get a language prediction in real time

## 📦 How It Works

### 🗂️ 1. Data Loading

The `load_file_paths_and_labels()` function walks through a directory, collects paths to `.mp3` files.

### 🧠 2. Speech-to-Text with Whisper

```python
whisper_model = whisper.load_model("base")
result = whisper_model.transcribe(path)
```
Loads the Whisper model (base size) from OpenAI, a pre-trained speech-to-text model.
For each audio file, it transcribes speech into text.


## 🧪 3. Preprocessing

- **MFCC features** are extracted from audio files during preprocessing. These features capture the short-term power spectrum of sound and are widely used in speech and audio recognition tasks.
- Transcribed text from the Whisper model is also collected for each audio file to be used in the classification step.

## 🔤 4. Text Classification Pipeline

After transcription and preprocessing:

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(texts, labels, test_size=0.2)
``` 
Texts (X) and labels (y) are split into training and test sets.

A simple pipeline is defined using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression:
```python
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('tfidf', TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(1, 2), max_features=10000)),
    ('clf', LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000))
])
```
TfidfVectorizer: Converts text to numerical vectors using term frequency-inverse document frequency.
LogisticRegression: A simple linear classifier that predicts the language label.

## Pipeline Summary

Audio → Text (via Whisper) → TF-IDF → Logistic Regression
